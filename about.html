                🙌 Why Design?
            </h1>
            <p id="content-p1">
                I followed an almost-full-time athlete’s schedule in high<br>school; weekdays and weekends were taken up by training,<br>and holidays were spent on the road to competitions in<br>other countries.
            </p>
            <p id="content-p2">
                Looking back, I faced a certain dimension of discipline and<br>adversity as an athlete, and I think that’s why I naturally lean<br>toward areas where I can stand tall (for myself and others)<br>when times are tough—in short, finding the silver lining in a<br>challenge. To me, the impact that human-centered design<br>and its subdivisions have on the world is that silver lining.            
            </p>
            <p id="content-p3">
                I have found so much joy in using my skills to strengthen<br>and empower the creative load of the teams I am on and,<br>most importantly, the lives of the individuals I design for. 💭            </p>
