            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>This project was the result of one of many two-week design sprints during my Fall 2019 Introduction to HCI Design class at UC Berkeley. 
                Our current class module called for my team to <span class="bold">“design for friction”</span> 
                through the use of subtle, unintrusive design choices that would discourage users from performing a certain action.
            </p>
            <p>As a two-person team, Jessie and I diverged early on in the project to research ideas for branding and create low fidelity wireframes. At the end of the sprint, we worked together on the high fidelity prototypes in Figma.</p>

            <p>We noticed the prevalence of fast food chain partnerships on popular food delivery apps such as Doordash and Uber Eats, 
                with the apps often featuring these brands on their front pages—making it easy for customers to choose these unhealthy options. 
                As a result, we wanted to use friction to <span class="bold">encourage healthy food ordering online and discourage the ordering of fast food.</span>

        <div id="solution" class="margin width">
            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>Our final deliverable was a high fidelity prototype of our app that showed our implementations of friction into our designs. This included stylistic choices, promotion of healthy menus, and greater caloric transparency.</p>

                    <h4 class="grey">Screen 2</h4>
                    <p>The home screen predominantly<br>features healthy restaurants,<br>echoing the pattern we observed on<br>popular food delivery apps. Each<br>header is somehow related to<br>healthy eating, and users will have
                        <br>to scroll far down to be able to see<br>less healthy food options.</p>
                    <p>We also added a “green” rating that<br>would show how each restaurant<br>stacked up against other healthy<br>restaurants. </p>

                    <h4 class="grey">Screen 3</h4>
                    <p>The individual restaurant screen has been<br>redesigned to include more cues for users<br>to eat healthy: in the banner image, there<br>are tags that show what the popular dish is<br>for the restaurant, its average caloric load,<br>and its average consumption speed.</p>
                    <p>The most important decision we made was<br>to include calorie amounts for each selection<br>(the text is purposely larger than the price<br>text in order to drive users to
                        prioritize what<br>they’re eating over how much they’re paying<br>for it).</p>

                    <h4 class="grey">Screen 4</h4>
                    <p>After selecting a dish, users<br>will be able to go through the<br>restaurant’s normal flow of<br>selecting meal size, sides, etc.<br>This process will now also
                        <br>include indicators of how the<br>meal is prepared to further<br>inform users of how healthy<br>their choice is.</p>

                    <h4 class="grey">Screen 5</h4>
                    <p>Finally, we drastically changed the checkout<br>card to resemble a nutritional facts label.<br>Not only will users be able to see the price<br>of their meal, but also extensive caloric and nutritional details of the ingredients they are about to consume.</p>

            <h1>Ideation</h1>
            <p>We knew that we wanted to introduce features that would create friction for the user, but how subtle or drastic would these cues be? Here were some initial ideas we came up with:</p>
            <img src="avoeats/ideas.png" width="736px" class="image">
            <p>While Jessie got started on the wireframes, I worked on the visual design for the app.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="moodboard" class="margin width">
            <h2>Moodboard</h2>
            <p>My first step was to create a moodboard to get a general feel for the colors, themes, and vibes of the topic we were focusing on. A simple Google search of “healthy food” yielded many images like these:</p>
            <img src="avoeats/moodboard.png" width="930px" class="image">
            <p>Overall, there was a lot of green. What caught my eye the most was the popularity of avocados in many of the dishes. I decided to center the branding around the color and shape of an avocado since it reliably seemed to bring a healthy connotation to screens.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="colors" class="margin width">
            <h2>Colors</h2>
            <p>Our color palette was derived directly from the main colors of an avocado.</p>
            <img src="avoeats/color palette.png" width="930px" class="image">
        </div>
        <div id="logo" class="margin width">
            <h2>Logo</h2>
            <p>Jessie and I came up with a long list of names for our app; among these we selected ‘AvoEats’ because it was concise and represented our avocado branding concept well. 
                I then worked on different versions of our logo: from wordmarks to symbols, I ended up with a combination logo that used our selected typeface, Rubik, and an original avocado icon.</p>

            <h1>Prototyping</h1>
            <p>The two of us reconvened on a turbulent, windy Wednesday night on Figma to churn out the final high fidelity prototypes for our in-class presentation the next day. We both worked on applying the branding theme to Jessie’s wireframes and generating buttons and tags.</p>
            <p>While working, we made sure to be mindful of several design techniques we had learned in class:</p>

        <div id="reflection" class="margin width">
            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>This being my first project using Figma (and my first foray into HCD), I definitely went through a steep learning curve. I’m very grateful that my partner was experienced and was able to take on the earlier steps of wireframing while I was still getting used to the application!</p>
            <p>That being said, we were both thrown into a tense situation when half of our team dropped the class, just days before the project deadline. My ability to learn on the spot was tested, but we were able to execute our designs and had a successful presentation in class.</p>
